# CS3219 Assignment Tasks B1-B4

## Overview

This is the repo for my submission for the CS3219 OTOT Assignment Tasks B1-B4 which consists of a small full stack web application.
The application models an inventory manager for an action figure collection where users can keep track of their action figure collection, their prices and if they are listing the action figure for sale or not.

### Implementation

This application was implemented using a MERN stack i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node, where Node and Express were used for the API server and React was used for the application's frontend. Travis CI/CD has been used for automated testing of the API server as well as automated deployment of both the frontend and the backend.
